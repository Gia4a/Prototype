# Data Connect specific files
dataconnect-debug.log      # Debug log for the Data Connect emulator
# 5432/                      # Some setups might create a directory for the Postgres data directly.
						   # If you see a directory named after your Postgres port (e.g., '5432') that
						   # stores actual database files locally, you should ignore it.

# Operating System Files
.DS_Store                  # macOS system files
Thumbs.db                  # Windows thumbnail cache

# VS Code specific files (optional - you might want to share some settings)
.vscode/
# Add .vscode/settings.json if you don't want to share user-specific settings
# Add .vscode/launch.json if you don't want to share debugger configurations

# Generated SDKs for Data Connect:
# NOTE: The generated SDKs (e.g., for React/Angular) are source code that your
# application depends on. You typically *DO* want to commit these to your repository,
# as they are part of your application's source. Do NOT add the directory where
# these are generated (e.g., src/data-connect/ or lib/data-connect/) here.
# If you configure Data Connect to output them to a 'temp' or 'build' directory
# that is already ignored, then that's fine.

# Service account keys (CRITICAL - DO NOT COMMIT!)
# If you downloaded a service account key JSON file and placed it directly
# in your project root, make sure its filename is here.
# Example: my-service-account-key.json
# Generally, it's safer to keep this file outside the project directory and
# reference it via an environment variable (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS).
